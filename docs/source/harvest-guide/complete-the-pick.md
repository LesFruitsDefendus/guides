# Deliver the fruits to the beneficiary and return the equipment to the storage site    

You have packed up your harvesting materials, and the volunteer pickers have gone home. Now it is the time to deliver one third of the fruit to the beneficiary organization that you have chosen previously.

When interacting with beneficiary organizations, please be sure to do the following:
- Introduce yourself and be sure that you are in the right place.
- Be courteous and patient. Some staff members may not be aware of the existing partnership with Les Fruits Défendus. Don’t forget that you are representing the collective!
- When parking the bicycle and trailer, remember to park it securely either by locking it or asking someone to keep an eye on it, or bring it inside.
