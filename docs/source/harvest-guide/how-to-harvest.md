# How to harvest and store fruit

Most fruit grows each year on the same parts of the branch (at the "spur"; see **Fig 1** ). If you destroy the spur while picking the fruit, you may compromise future harvests. Moreover, how fruit is picked can influence its conservation once stored.
Keep in mind that you have less chance of damaging the tree when you pick the fruit correctly and at the right time.
Follow these **general harvesting tips** to ensure the protection of the tree and its fruit:

**Fig 1**  (TODO : INSERT PHOTO of spur and stem)

- Fruit should be picked with the stem, but without the spur.
- Never cut the stem of the fruit.
- Try to not pull down a fruit; it is always better to lift it.
- Do not do anything which damages the bark of the tree. It is its circulatory system!
- NEVER CUT THE BRANCHES OF FRUIT TREES DURING THE SUMMER! Even if the owner requests this, be aware that we are not qualified to provide such services; therefore, we must decline any such requests.
- When using a picking bucket (hung around the neck) to pick fruit, don’t allow the bucket get too full, because the fruit will inevitably spill!
Below are some **specific harvesting tips** for different kinds of fruit:

**Fig 2** (TODO : INSERT PHOTO, apple harvest)

### Apples

Apples must be picked with a "rotation gesture" accompanied by a slight lift. If the fruit does not come off easily, then it is not mature.
- By hand: Turn the apple while slightly raising and pull gently. Do not pull down on the fruit. 
- With fruit picking tool: position the metal part around the apple, lift slightly and rotate (see Fig 2). Do not pull down on the fruit.

### Cherries

Cherries should be picked with the stem intact, if possible—otherwise, they will spoil quickly! 
- By hand: Grasp the knot at the top of the stem. Either twist or gently push sideways or upwards, until the knot of the stem comes apart from the spur. **Do not pull down on the stem. Do not use scissors to cut the stem**.

### Plums

Plums can be picked like apples. A ripe plum is easily removed from the tree.
- By hand: Turn the fruit gently upward. **Do not pull down on the fruit**.
- With fruit picking tool: Position the metal part around the plum, lift slightly and rotate. **Do not pull down on the fruit**.

### Pears
Pears can be picked like apples (see section above)– but remember that they must be picked before they are completely ripe, so removing them from the tree can be slightly more tricky. Therefore, when harvesting pears, take extra care not pull on the fruit and damage the spurs!

### Saskatoon berries
- By hand: Pick off berries gently by hand.

### Grapes
- By hand: Cut off each bunch of grapes using a pair of scissors or pruning shears.

## Storage:

**At Santropol Roulant**, all fruits except apples can be put in the walk-in fridge in the basement of the building (a.k.a. cold room, cold storage). Apples can be put on the Fruits Défendus shelf unless they are in danger of rotting. Please don’t place containers on the floor of the walk-in fridge.

- Soft fruits (cherries, Saskatoon berries, plums, grapes) should be stored in a way where they do not get crushed under their own weight. Therefore, use small bags and try not to pile the bags on top of each other. If you can, we recommend using recyclable plastic produce containers (rigid packaging used for selling mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, strawberries, etc.) to transport and store soft fruit. Wooden boxes used to sell clementines can also be used for this.
- Pears must be stored in a space where the temperature is around 0 ° C, e.g. a cool room, otherwise they will continue to mature. Pears stored at room temperature will mature quickly and can only be eaten for a few days after picking. If you store un-ripe pears at a cold temperature, you can pile them on top of each other without a problem.
