# Annex 2: Ladder Security

**Our ladders are all very similar, with three hinges so that they can be configured at least three ways: collapsed like the letter “W” for transport, folded like an upside-down “V” for a free-standing position, or opened straight like the letter “I” for a leaning position. Please consult the instructions on the side of the ladder. (Our “Featherlite Combi 3316” model of stepladders, which have three screw-type hinges, can be used in eight different ways.)**

For fruit picks, we find that the most useful setups are the 6-ft folded stepladder (upside-down “V” position) and the 12-foot straight ladder (“I” position).

**Be sure to give instructions on safe ladder use at the beginning of every pick to help ensure everyone is using the ladder safely.**

## Inspection

- Always visually inspect the ladder before installing it and using it for a pick.
- During your visual inspection, keep an eye out for cracks and deterioration. Check that the rungs/steps and side rails are in good condition. Moreover, make sure the hinges are secure and tight before climbing.

## Installation

- When moving the ladder, ask for assistance if necessary.
- If you are using the ladder as a **straight ladder**, make sure to prop it against a flat surface, e.g. a wall or a stable horizontal branch, if available. Do not lean it on a tree trunk. If there is any doubt about the ladder’s stability, tie down the top of the ladder to something secure to prevent sliding up and down and side-to-side.
- When propping a **straight ladder** against a flat, vertical surface, it should be position at a 75° angle relative to that surface. In other words, the feet of the ladder should be positioned at a distance of 1⁄4 of the extended length away from the wall.

- The feet of the ladder, or rubber stoppers, need to be on the ground, not on a stone or a bench.
- To adjust the ladder, adjust the hinges and fold the ladder into place on the ground. Once the hinges are secured at the proper angle, lift the ladder. **Assure that all the hinges are secure (all screw hinges tightened, if applicable) before letting volunteers climb the ladder.**
- Always check that the ladder is stable before allowing volunteers to climb it.

## Usage


- We always require that someone secure the ladder and keep it stable with both hands by standing at the bottom and facing the ladder.
- The person climbing the ladder always needs to be in contact with **three points** at all times, e.g. the ladder’s side rail, two feet on the rungs/steps and/or hand on the tree. No extending oneself to reach fruits, branches or anything else. We do not want anyone getting hurt trying to get that last cherry.
- Always make sure the person climbing the ladder is facing the ladder as well as the person securing the ladder.
- Climb and descend equipment facing the ladder (and not on the side) and wait until the person is on the ladder and climbed on/or off completely before passing objects and equipment to them.
- Be extra careful when it is wet as the rungs may be slippery.
- One person per ladder. The only exception is when using our Featherlite 3316 in the wide and low stepladder configuration (see Fig.1 above), where one person can stand on the third step of each side.
