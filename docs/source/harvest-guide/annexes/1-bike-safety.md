#  Information on bike safety and the trailer

We know well that Montreal cyclists do not always follow the Highway Code to the letter, but when pulling a trailer, you should be extremely prudent. Be more than vigilant!

- Plan your route well in advance using bike path maps available to you in our binder or available online [here](http://www.velo.qc.ca/fr/publication.php?id=5112010)
- Remember that you will travel slower with a trailer and remember that turning requires extra attention.
- Look around you, be visible and predictable
- Bike upright
- We suggest that you wear a helmet
- Always signal your intention to turn
- Do not ride on the sidewalk
- Do not bike in a prohibited direction
- Use your bell
- Do not forget to lock your bike
- Turn on your lights when necessary (nightfall, rain)

**How to attach the trailer**:

If you use your own bike, follow steps 1 and 2. If you use the Les Fruits DÃ©fendus bike then begin at step 2.

**1. Attach the hitch to your bike:**
- Place the protective hose over the seatstay and chainstay tubes (Fig 1)--
this will protect the paint and frame
of the bike. The longer piece of hose should be placed on the chainstay
and the shorter hose on the the seatstay.
- Set the hitch on the protective hose on the chainstay near the junction of the seatstay and chainstay (Fig. 2).
- Wrap a band clamp around each end of the angle and chainstay so the excess end of the clamps points up and inward (Fig 3.). Tighten loosely. Put the remaining band clamp around both the vertical rod and seatstay. Tighten all band clamps securely.

**2. Attach the trailer to the tow hook:**

Place the towbar bushings on both sides of the ball of the rod end. 
Line up the holes so the hitchpin can fit down through the bushings and rod end (Fig.4.). 
Take the hitchpin clip and swing it around behind the solid part of the towbar and stretch the clasp so it goes around the bottom end of the pin (Fig.5.).

You are now ready to use your trailer.
