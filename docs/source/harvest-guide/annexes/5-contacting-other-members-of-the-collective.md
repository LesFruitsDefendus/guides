# Annex 5: Contacting other members of the collective

Les Fruits Défendus is a project created and led entirely by a group of volunteers, and is supported by Santropol Roulant.

New pick-leaders are paired with a member of the core, called a “fruit buddy.” He or she is your primary contact person for questions related to organizing and leading picks.

We also ask our community of pickleaders to help support each other by sharing questions and expertise through LFD’s closed [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1915569122052107/) for pickleaders.

For those not using Facebook, we encourage pickleaders to exchange contacts (phone and/or email).

If you need to reach the core for general questions, please write to info@lesfruitsdefendus.org. For urgent, significant technical issues regarding Saskatoon, please contact

tech@lesfruitsdefendus.org. We’ll do our best to respond to your inquiries as soon as possible. In case of emergency involving personal safety during a pick, please call 911.
