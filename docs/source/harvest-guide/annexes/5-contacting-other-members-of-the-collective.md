# Annex 5: Contacting other members of the collective

Les Fruits Défendus is a project created and led entirely by a group of volunteers, and is supported by Santropol Roulant.

New pick-leaders are paired with a member of the core, called a "fruit buddy." He or she is your primary contact person for questions related to organizing and leading picks.

We also ask our community of pick-leaders to help support each other by sharing questions and expertise through Les Fruits Défendus's [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1915569122052107/) for pick-leaders.

For those not using Facebook, we encourage pick-leaders to exchange contacts (phone and/or email).

If you need to reach the core for general questions, please write to [info@lesfruitsdefendus.org](mailto:info@lesfruitsdefendus.org). For urgent, significant technical issues regarding Saskatoon, please contact [tech@lesfruitsdefendus.org](mailto:tech@lesfruitsdefendus.org). We'll do our best to respond to your inquiries as soon as possible. In case of emergency involving personal safety during a pick, please call 911.
