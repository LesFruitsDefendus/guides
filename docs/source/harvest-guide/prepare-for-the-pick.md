# Prepare for the pick

The majority of Les Fruits Défendus' picks take place on private, residential property. It's therefore very important to treat the properties with the utmost respect.

When you arrive at the pick site, knock on the door and introduce yourself. Even if no one's expected to be home, it's always a good idea to knock. If the tree owners are at home, you can ask them for small garbage bags or a compost bin for the fallen/spoiled fruits, as well as a container for their portion of the fruit, and a ladder or step stool, if required.

Take time to talk to the tree owner(s) and answer their questions about the collective. Be polite and positive! You represent Les Fruits Défendus, so be sure to put your best foot forward!

## Additional steps to prepare for the pick:

- Inspect the pick site for potential hazards during the pick.
- Unload the equipment from the bike trailer.
- Prepare the garbage bags used to collect fruit that falls during the pick (freshly fallen
fruit). **Please review the table below to familiarize yourself with our policies regarding fallen fruit**.

## Fallen fruit

In the interest of health and sanitation, Les Fruits Défendus does not donate fruit that has come in contact with the ground. This rule also applies to the fruit given to the tree owner. Please consult the following table for procedures regarding fallen fruit and the corresponding rationale.
