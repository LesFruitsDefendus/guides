# Life Cycle of a Pick on Saskatoon

As a pick-leader, you will be using Saskatoon to plan your picks. Saskatoon shows a list of available "harvests", each of which corresponds to a potential harvest of a fruit tree or vine.

Each year, tree-owners from our community complete an online form indicating their interest in having us harvest their fruit. Consequently, Saskatoon creates a new "harvest" (a.k.a harvest record) for that year. 

Additionally, a given property may have more than one type of fruit tree (or vine), each with its own distinct harvesting period. Each tree or vine can yield fruit over a period of several weeks, thus allowing more than one harvest to be scheduled for that tree/vine. 

It's for these reasons that we use the term "harvest" in Saskatoon, rather than "tree". These "harvests" will help you plan your harvesting events.

Each stage of planning and fulfilling a harvest event is referred to as a harvest "Status". Here's an overview of each harvest status:

- **To be confirmed**: (Please ignore.)
- **Orphan**: The tree-owner gave us the "okay" to harvest their tree this season, but no pick-leader has selected it yet.
- **Adopted**: A pick-leader has assigned his/herself to the tree.
- **Date scheduled**: A pick-leader has confirmed a harvest date with the tree owner. The pick is published publicly in the calendar so that volunteers can sign up.
- **Ready**: The team of pickers has been confirmed, and subscription to the pick is closed (i.e., it is no longer possible to sign up for the pick using the calendar).
- **Succeeded**: The fruit has been successfully picked.
- **Cancelled**: Sadly, the tree or vine will not be harvested this year. Notes detailing why this is the case will be recorded in Saskatoon.
