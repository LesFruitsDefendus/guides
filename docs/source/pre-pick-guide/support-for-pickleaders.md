# Support for Pickleaders

New pickleaders are paired with a member of the core, called a “fruit buddy”. He or she is your primary contact person for questions related to organizing and leading picks.

We also ask our community of pick-leaders to help support each other by sharing questions and expertise through LFD’s closed Facebook group for pick-leaders: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1915569122052107/.

For those not using Facebook, we encourage pick leaders to exchange contacts (phone and/or email).

If you need to reach the core for general questions, please write to info@lesfruitsdefendus.org. For urgent, significant technical issues regarding Saskatoon, please contact tech@lesfruitsdefendus.org. We’ll do our best to respond to your inquiries as soon as possible.

In case of emergency involving personal safety during a pick, please call 911.
