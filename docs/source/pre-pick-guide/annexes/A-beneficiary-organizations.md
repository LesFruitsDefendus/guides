# Annex A: Beneficiary organizations

A beneficiary organization is a partner to whom we donate 1/3 of the fruit we harvest during a pick. Beneficiary organizations ensure the redistribution of the fruit to those in need and promote food security.

During the harvest season, our list of beneficiary organizations will be updated regularly, therefore, you should refer to the most current version on Saskatoon.
