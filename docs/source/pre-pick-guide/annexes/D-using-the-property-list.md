# Planning Harvests using the Properties List

## Introduction

The simplest, fastest way to start organizing a harvest event is to adopt an "Orphan Harvest" in Saskatoon.

But if you'd like to **choose from a larger list of possible trees in our database**, this annex will show you how to identify and directly reach out to tree-owners who have shown past interest in our collective, but haven't yet let us know whether we may harvest at their property this year. The process described below involves a deeper understanding of how our database functions, and requires some additional data entry on your part, but it also allows you to access fruit trees and vines that you otherwise wouldn't be able to and which may ideally suit your preferences.

If you'd like to choose from a more comprehensive list of properties in our network, please read this guide thoroughly and follow its instructions closely. In this case, the process of planning a harvest will start with the steps described below. Once you've completed these important steps, please refer to the Pre-Pick Guide for guidance on scheduling a harvest date, assembling a picking team and all remaining parts of planning your pick.

## Tree-Owner Sign-Up Form

Before the harvesting season gets started, we ask all tree-owners to use our online form, available at [www.lesfruitsdefendus.org](http://www.lesfruitsdefendus.org), to indicate that they authorize harvesting this season. When a form is submitted, the information updates directly in Saskatoon, and the core creates an orphan harvest for that property. We'll show you how to choose among properties whose owners haven't filled out the form this year.

## The Properties List: Choosing an Eligible Tree/Vine to Harvest

Once you've logged-in to Saskatoon and accessed the main page (see Pre-Pick guide for instructions on this), select the "Properties" tab on the main menu. Here, you'll find a list of all properties recorded in Saskatoon.

Separate columns show information such as tree-owner, address, status, fruit type, picks from past years, etc. We'll explain more about specific property information in the section below called "Reviewing Property Information". First, let's focus on the information shown in the Status column.

### Understanding a Property's Statuses

To quickly see our entire list of properties, make sure that "All" is selected in the drop-down list next to "Show" near the upper left corner.

When choosing a property, your best bet will be to choose among the properties which display 🟢 "Validated" and 🟡 "Not Yet Authorized" icons under the Status column. To see a list of these properties, you can sort by the Status column or use the filters. (For more detail on how to do either of these, please see the section called "Sorting and Filtering Properties" below. )

First, some background explanation on what each of the different property statuses mean...

#### Authorization status

Authorization status indicates whether the tree-owner has confirmed their interest in having their fruit harvested this year. Tree-owners use the online form to authorize their tree(s)/vine(s) for the season.

- 🟢 "Authorized": We have permission to harvest on the property this year. 😊
- 🔴 "Unauthorized": We do not have permission to harvest on the property at all this year.
The tree-owner does not want us to follow up with them this year to schedule a pick.
(They haven't necessarily said no for future seasons, just for the current one.)
- 🟡 "Not Yet Authorized": The tree-owner hasn't responded to our form this year, but it's
possible they intend to. Properties in this category have given us permission to harvest at some point since 2016, and in many cases, we've completed at least one successful harvest there since then. If you're interested in harvesting at one of these properties, you will first need to contact the tree-owner to ask for their permission to harvest during the current season before trying to actually schedule a pick. Understand that they may, in fact, not authorize harvesting at all this year, for a number of possible reasons.

```{admonition} Important
:class: warning

Before contacting a tree owner to confirm their interest for this year, you must first double-check if a harvest record has already been created for that property for this year. If so, and if that harvest hasn't already been adopted by another pick-leader, then you may adopt it and proceed to plan the harvest, as described in the Pre-Pick guide. If not, you will need to create and adopt a new "Harvest". This will prevent the conflict of other pick-leaders contacting the same tree-owner to try and schedule their own harvest of that tree/vine. Details on creating and adopting your own harvest are provided further below.
```

#### Validation status

You may notice new properties that say "Pending" under the "Status" column. **These properties are not ready for you to select. Please do not create harvests for these properties yourself**. They've recently had their info submitted via the online tree-owner form and they require validation by an administrator (core member).

Validation involves a core member...
1. ...checking that a newly-created property is not actually a duplicate of another existing
property record in the database, and...
2. ...updating property record, if applicable

Once a property has been validated, its "Pending" status changes to "Validated", and an orphan harvest is created for it at the same time. Please note that if you're interested in harvesting at an "Authorized" property which is "Pending" validation, you may request that its harvest be adopted in your name as soon as it's created (more on this in the Property Status grid, further below).


- 🟢 "Validated": The property record has been validated by the core. It is a "valid" property (not a duplicate or an incomplete listing). If the property has had its information updated for the current season, this info has been validated by the core.
- 🟡 "Pending" (or "Pending Validation"): The property record has not yet been validated by the core. Please do not create a harvest for this property. The property record may be invalid or it may be a duplicate of another existing property. If so, it will need to be deleted by an administrator.
- Property records with "DELETE" in the name: This property record is either invalid or a duplicate and is waiting to be deleted by a member of the tech team. Please do not create a harvest for this property. If you're interested in the property, you're welcome to check if it's a duplicate of a valid property by searching its address or tree-owner.

### Knowing Which Properties to Contact

#### Property Status Grid

To know generally what action you may take for each combination of Authorization and Validation statuses, please consult the following grid:

|| 🟢 Authorized | 🔴 Unauthorized | 🟡 Not yet authorized
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 Validated | A harvest should have already been created for this property. If it hasn't already been adopted by another pick-leader, you're welcome to adopt the harvest! | Tree-owner doesn't want a harvest at their property this season. Do not contact this year. | Tree-owner hasn't responded yet. If you want to harvest at this property, please create & adopt a harvest first, then contact the tree- owner and ask if they authorize a harvest. |
| 🟡 Pending (validation) | Tree-owner wants a harvest this season. However, the core must first validate the tree-owner's registration. **Please do not create an orphan harvest or directly contact the tree-owner yet**. If you want to harvest at this property, please write a comment in the property notes that you'd like to adopt the harvest, and the validating core member can immediately adopt it in your name as soon as they create it (if applicable). | Tree-owner doesn't want a harvest this season. Do not contact this year. (Core must validate the authorization info submitted by the tree-owner.) | This combination shouldn't exist. If it does, it probably means that the tree-owner submitted a form but forgot to indicate whether they authorize harvesting this year or not. Please ask a core member to follow up if you're interested in this property. |

#### Active status:

```{admonition} Note
:class: note

By default, in the Properties List, no icon is displayed for properties who are "Active". You'll automatically know a property is "Active" if you see icons for its Authorization and Validation statuses. Alternatively, for properties who are "Inactive", neither Authorization nor Validation statuses will display, since for these properties they're irrelevant. Only an "Inactive" icon will be visible.]
```

The use of "Active" status has changed in the course of the past few years. Originally, it was used in the way that Authorization status is used now. But in 2018, during the introduction of the online property sign-up form, we created the new "Authorization" status, which communicates harvesting authorization, specific to a given season. At the same time, we adapted the meaning of "Active" status to signify a property's harvesting authorization in the long-term.

To best explain the meaning of "Active" and "Inactive", it's important to understand both their historical meaning and their current meaning:

- 🟢 "Active":
    - If a property has this value, it means that... The tree-owner authorized harvesting
    at some point in the past, and as far as we know, has not unauthorized harvesting at
    any time since then.
    - From now on, assign this value to a property if... The tree-owner is okay with us
contacting them to ask permission to harvest year after year.
- 🔴 "Inactive":
    - **If a property has this value, it means that...** The tree-owner hasn't necessarily denied authorization to harvest at their property ever again. We do have a few "Inactive" properties whose owners have asked not be contacted in the future for various reasons. But the majority of our "Inactive" properties have maintained an "Inactive" status simply because the tree-owners did not explicitly authorize a harvest for 2016, the year that Saskatoon was launched. So, just to be sure, please check for notes in the "About this Property" field of the property record. Also check for notes in all harvests listed under "Harvests at this Property" (see "Reviewing Property Information" section below):
        - If there are any notes indicating that at some point the tree-owner asked not to be contacted in future years, do not contact them.
        - **If, on the other hand, you don't see any indication in the property record that a tree-owner ever specifically asked us to stop contacting them, then it's OKAY for you to contact them and ask if they would be interested in having their fruit harvested this year! (\*)**
    - From now on, assign this value to a property if... The tree-owner has asked not to be contacted in future years. Include detailed notes indicating this and explain the situation in the "About this Property" field of the property record. We will continue to keep the property record in the database indefinitely for reference purposes, and in case the situation changes.
- ("Unknown": This status includes both active and inactive)

```{admonition} (*) Important Reminder
:class: warning

Before contacting a tree owner to confirm their interest for this year, you must first double-check if a harvest record has already been created for that property for this year. If so, and if that harvest hasn't already been adopted by another pick-leader, then you may adopt it and proceed to plan the harvest, as described in the Pre-Pick guide. If not, you will need to create and adopt a new "Harvest". This will prevent the conflict of other pick- leaders contacting the same tree-owner to try and schedule their own harvest of that tree/vine. Details on creating and adopting your own harvest are provided further below.
```

You're always welcome to ask the core if you're unsure about whether it's okay to contact a tree- owner directly.

### Sorting and Filtering Properties

To help identify trees/vines that interest you in the Properties List, you may either sort or filter the list according to the characteristics of your choice.

#### Sorting Columns

To sort, simply click at the top of a column, and all properties will be sorted into groups according to that category.

- **"#"**: Shows the Property ID – not to be confused with the Harvest ID(s) for any accompanying harvest(s).
"Property": Displays the tree-owner's name, "at", property's address.
- **"Status"**: Includes icons for either the property's Authorization + Validation statuses, or its Active status. If the property is Active, by default no "Active" icon will display – only the icons for its Authorization & Validation statuses. If the property is Inactive, the only icon that will appear in this column will be an "Inactive" icon (no Authorization nor Validation icons will display).
- **"Tree"**: Displays all fruit types present at this property.
- **"Picks"**: Shows the total number of harvests adopted at this property since 2016. Green baskets represent "Successful", completed harvests. Brown means "Scheduled" or "Ready". Red means the harvest was "Cancelled".
- **"Last Pick":** Displays the year fruit was last harvested at this property.

#### Filtering Properties

To filter properties in the list, choose a category from the filters and select from the drop- down list to display only the properties with that characteristic. Here are the categories by which you can filter properties:

- Active status
- Authorization status
- Validation status
- Neighborhood
- Fruit type [referred to as "Tree"]
- Availability of a Ladder

Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously. To be sure that the filter is not being applied, set it to "Unknown".

<!--- 
This has been commented out because the new version doesn't have theses buttons.

Buttons offer access to more specific information about this property:
- "View Property" button ( white "eye" icon in light blue square): Click to view property information [more on this in "Reviewing Property Information" just below.]
- "Edit Property" button (white "pencil" icon in yellow-orange square): Click to edit property information [more on this in the section below called "Script for Contacting Tree-Owner and Editing Property Information"].

## Reviewing Property Information

To learn more about a particular tree or vine in the Properties List, open its "Property record" by clicking on the property owner name and address. Here, information is listed about the property and the tree-owner.

### Property Record vs. Harvest Record 

The difference between the information recorded here in the Property record (page) and in the Harvest record (page) is that the information here is more permanent or ongoing, and isn't likely to change from one year to another. On the other hand, any information recorded in the Harvest record should be more specific to its year (e.g. the tree-owner would like to participate in the harvest this year, there's construction happening on the property over the summer, etc.).

#### Photo(s)

One or more photos of the property may be displayed here.

#### About this Property
This section lists most of the information about the tree and property. The left side shows the fruit types for all trees/vines as well as their location on the property. Any specific hand-written details about the property are also included in this section. 

#### Property features
On the right side, you'll see a checklist of information including up to nine of the following characteristics:
- Active status
- Validation status
- Authorization status
- Accessibility of the tree(s)/vine(s) (e.g. publicly accessible on the front sidewalk)
- Number of recommended pickers
- Availability of a Compost bin
- Availability of a Ladder (for the moment, we include information about equipment here,
rather than on the "Equipment" page of Saskatoon)
- Produces fruits every year (some trees produce fruit once every two years)
- Neighborhood [to be added here soon]
These characteristics correspond somewhat to those that can be used to filter properties in the Properties List.

##### Property Statuses
For the three property status types, you will see an icon, depending on the status value, as follows:
- ACTIVE:
    - ❌ = Inactive (If the property is Active, no icon will display)
- VALIDATION:
    - ✅ = Validated
    - ❌   = Pending Validation 
- AUTHORIZATION:
    - ✅ = Authorized for the Current Season (a.k.a. Authorized)
    - ❌ = Not Authorized for this Season (a.k.a. Unauthorized)

##### Other Characteristics
A check (✅) or an (❌) accompanies descriptive text for all the remaining characteristics.

#### Owner Information
Contact information for the tree-owner (name, telephone, email and language preference) is displayed here. This info is actually recorded outside of the Property record by an administrator and is not editable within the Property record. If it needs to be edited, please contact a core member.

#### Harvests at this Property
If there have been any harvests at this property since 2016, their harvest records are listed in this section, along with their Harvest ID, Pick-leader, Fruit type, Harvest status and Date Harvested (if applicable). Click on a harvest record to open it and review helpful information or comments.

## Creating and Adopting a Harvest


To create a harvest record, click on the "New harvest" icon .

```{admonition} (1) Important 
:class: warning

You will be asked to add any applicable "Fruit type"s, select an estimated start and end date (can be a harvest date range), and type an estimated number of pickers. Information here can be modified later on when you contact the tree owner. You will also need to add placeholder text to the "Public announcement" section. You may quickly select a smiley icon or type a note to the pickers. Please just keep in mind that this text will eventually be displayed publicly in the calendar, unless you change it later.
```

Click "Save" to create your new harvest record.

## Contacting Tree-Owner for Authorization

**Before contacting the tree-owner, review info from any past harvest records at this property.** That way, you'll be prepared to ask for confirmation of that information. When you're ready to contact the tree-owner, please use the suggested script in the next section as a guide for asking permission to harvest and for updating information in the Property record.

If the tree-owner authorizes a harvest, once they've answered questions and you've updated information in Saskatoon, the two of you can follow up on scheduling the harvest, either immediately or eventually.

Once the harvest is scheduled, you'll need to continue with the remaining steps for planning a pick, starting with the section "Find a beneficiary organization that will receive the fruit" in the Pre-Pick guide.

Many thanks and the best of luck to you in planning and leading your harvest! 😊
