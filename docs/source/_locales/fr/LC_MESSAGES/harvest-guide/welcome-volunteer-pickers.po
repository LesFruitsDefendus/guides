"A fruit pick is a fun, social activity, and a large part of your role as "
"pick leader consists of ensuring that everyone enjoys themselves. To "
"facilitate this, please welcome the volunteer pickers with a smile, "
"encourage introductions to one another, and initiate conversation if "
"you're comfortable doing so (if you're more introverted, don't worry! -- "
"generally, volunteer pickers get to work right away and often end up "
"chatting a lot among one another)."
