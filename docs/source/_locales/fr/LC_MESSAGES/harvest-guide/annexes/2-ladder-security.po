"**Our ladders are all very similar, with three hinges so that they can be"
" configured at least three ways: collapsed like the letter \"W\" for "
"transport, folded like an upside-down \"V\" for a free-standing position,"
" or opened straight like the letter \"I\" for a leaning position. Please "
"consult the instructions on the side of the ladder. (Our \"Featherlite "
"Combi 3316\" model of stepladders, which have three screw-type hinges, "
"can be used in eight different ways.)**"
