"Each harvest is different. Sometimes the trees are full of fruit, but it "
"can also happen that a gust of wind made everything fall overnight. One "

"Picks generally lasts two hours. Sometimes it takes less time to harvest "
"the fruit, and sometimes two hours is not enough time to collect all the "
"fruit. We do our best to harvest as much as we can in the timeframe we "

" for all of the volunteer pickers. Further divide the volunteer pickers' "
