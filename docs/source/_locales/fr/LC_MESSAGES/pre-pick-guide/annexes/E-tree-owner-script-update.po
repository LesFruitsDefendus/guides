"Below is a script you may use when contacting the tree-owner (either by "

"provided within the contents of the script itself. As always, we ask that"
" you help encourage success in future seasons by documenting as much "
"information in the property and harvest records as you can. The more the "
"better!"

"You may choose to contact the tree-owner two times if you prefer. The "
"first time could be as early as you'd like â€“ mainly to ask for "
"authorization, gather the most pertinent information, and ask for an "
"estimate on when the fruit will be ripe. The follow-up call or email "
"could be to schedule the actual harvest and get more detailed "
"information. If the tree-owner authorizes a harvest, you do have the "
"option of asking them to just fill out the online form themselves. While "
"this might seem to save you time, not only are you depending on the tree-"
" owner to follow up quickly, but once they've submitted the form, it will"
" still require validation from a core member. For a harvest that's still "
"several weeks away, the wait may not be an issue. But in the case of "
"quickly ripening fruit, there's a clear advantage to getting these "
"questions answered over the phone, or even by email. Plus, you may be "
"able to schedule the harvest during the same conversation!"
